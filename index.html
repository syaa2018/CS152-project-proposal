<b>Age Predictions: Machine Learning and Racial Ethics<b>

Project Description:
In this project, I would like to first train neural networks (NNs) to predict age using photographs of faces, and second, put them to a cross-cultural test and contextualize my findings within a larger ethical discussion. Specifically, I would like to train the NN on facial photographs of Western/European individuals, and then assess the accuracy of the NN in predicting the age of POC (e.g. Asian) individuals. 

There are many ethical implications to my project. As I develop my project, I will need to answer these questionsâ€”do people want to have their age predicted? Can machine learning models be applied cross-culturally, or will ethnic biases undermine their efficacy and overall purpose? It would be immensely interesting to draw connections to modern-day facial recognition technologies, which discriminate against POC largely because standard training databases are predominantly white and male. 

Project Goals:
1. Train a NN to predict age using only data from Western/European individuals.
2. Test the NN on ethnically diverse datasets (e.g. Asian photographs of faces). 
3. Use my findings to contribute to the discussion around machine learning ethics (e.g. facial recognition technologies).
